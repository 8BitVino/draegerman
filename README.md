# Draegerman
An 8bit retro game for the Agon Light by 8BitVino 2023

This is a shareware version of Draegerman for the AgonLight2.
Step into the role of a brave draegerman, whose mission is to save trapped miners deep within the treacherous underground mines!
As you descend into the depths you'll use dynamite to blast through blocked paths, collect valuable gold and gems but need to strategically plan your resupply trips to the store.

Conserve your explosives and use them wisely!
Save the miners before they run out of oxygen!
Don't get trapped without a way out!
Watch out for caveins!

With each new level, the challenge escalates, putting your competencies as a Draegerman to the ultimate test.
